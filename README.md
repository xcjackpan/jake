RAKE, short for Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction, is a domain independent keyword extraction algorithm 
which tries to determine key phrases in a body of text by analyzing the frequency of word appearance and its co-occurance
with other words in the text.

RAKE is described in this paper: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227988510_Automatic_Keyword_Extraction_from_Individual_Documents
